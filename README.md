# dotfiles

Collection of my dotfiles, so that I won't go though the pain of setting up each machine manually from scratch when I break my system :) (I use Arch btw ðŸ˜†)

this was inspired by [hackernews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797), the easiest way to store and track your `dotfiles`.
